Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is a concept or rather a field in computer science that deals with creation, development and maintenance of software. It is a concept of conjoined engineering and computer science to ensure the software are running efficiently.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering, as compared to traditional programming deals and handles software as a whole; its, creation, development, testing and maintenance. Traditional programming on the other hand focusses on the coding part of the software

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Planning- The stage of planning involves the process of finding and allocating resources, estimating cost, time and checking feasibility.
Requirement analysis- In this stage the developers seek from the stakeholders what is needed for the software. E.g. Documents
 Design- Design involves drafting the outlook of the software i.e the interface, database e.t.c
 Implementation- This is the stage where the developers actualize what they had designed. It typically involves the coding bit
 Testing- This involves running the software and fixing where a problem is found
 Deployment- This is now exposing it to the environment i.e. introducing it to the users
 Maintenance- Maintenance basically involves tending for the software; Fixing issues arising like bugs, developing it further e.t.c.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Agile model is the software development process that involves incremental bit by bit or small adjustments to the software. It emphasizes on flexibility, collaboration and customer satisfaction
The waterfall model on the other hand is rather a flowing process through the development process
Differences
-Agile utilizes an incremental approach where the project is divided into small bits that are developed incrementally while Waterfall model is a flowing process where one stage has to be completed before moving to the other. When the project is prone to changes Agile is preferred since it accommodates quick changes.
-Agile is much more flexible as compared to waterfall i.e it easily adapts to changes as quick changes can be made in the process. As far as stability is concerned, Waterfall will be the most preferred since once it's well understood its unlikely to change.
-Agile is able to incorporate feedback from the customers as it is been developed in comparison to waterfall which collaboration with customers can be difficult. When it comes to customer collaboration, Agile is preferred more since customers get to participate more in the project.
-Agile requires less documentation as compared to waterfall which requires documentation at each phase. Comparatively, as far as regulatory compliance is concerned, waterfall is the best fit.
In conclusion , Agile, evident as per the current industry and tech world, is commonly used in software industry due to its flexibility, adaptability etc

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering involves gathering, documenting , scrutinizing and maintenance of the paraphernalia needed in developing a software.
Process and Importance
-Elicitation- identification of the stakeholders and the requirements they require. This will help to differentiate and analyze what the system should and should not do
-Analysis- Ensuring that the the requirements are available and feasible
This will help enhance quality assurance for the system
-Documentation- Sorting the necessary documents presented in a formal and structured manner. This will enhance quality of the system and viability and hence easily trusted by customers.
-Validation- Validating that the requirements align with the stakeholders needs. This will bring the aspect of alignment and the objective will be easily attained.
-Maintenance- This involves, monitoring, changing and advancing where necessary. This will assist in keeping the system aligned to the objectives and goals set.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

It involves the breaking down a system into small reusable components called modules. These modules have their particular tasks and can be developed, tested and maintained as distinct modules
-It improves maintainability by distinguishing each module and evaluating its changes separately. This helps mitigate unexpected effects
-It improves scalability due to its component of reusability where the different modules can be reused for new projects saving time and effort without necessarily compromising the quality.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

-Unit testing- Testing of individual units to evaluate if it meets specifications
-Integration testing- Testing the interconnected units. The main focus is evaluating the relatedness of the units of the software
-System testing- Testing the system as a whole. To check if the outlined/planned goals have been met
-Acceptance testing- To check if its acceptable i.e if it meets the requirements of it's clients
Importance
-Product quality- quality is enhanced for the system
-Organizational productivity- The output of an organization is enhanced
-Prevents catastrophes- Hence unexpected errors and risks will be mitigated
-Improved customer experience- When the system has been thoroughly tested, its quality is improved and errors and bugs are fixed. This will ease user experience

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are tools that assist software engineers to control computer files(codes) and manage changes through time. They enhance review and innovation thus improving coding over time.
examples
Git- Distributed vcs known for its speed, data integrity etc
GitLab- Known for features such as an integrated project, project website etc.
Beanstalk- its a vcs that uses browser and cloud and known for projects involving outsourcing.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Roles of a software project manager include, setting objectives, analyzing the setbacks/constraints, integrating the teams, establishing a time plan and monitoring performance
responsibilities
-planning
-Overseeing the operations
-Delegation duties
-Monitoring
-Managing the different variables e.g. Budget
Challenges
-Risk management
-Coordination and communication
-Lack of accountability
 -Budget problems

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of adjusting, updating and correcting software to align with customer needs. The activities include;
-Product optimization- Eradicating the defects realized
-Infrastructure management- involves organizing, auditing and documentation of the software infrastructure
Disaster management- System backups to boost security by use of firewalls etc
-Application maintenance- Support of live systems to boost continuity
Importance
-Saves on costs 
-Reduces the hassle of adding new features
-Time management

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

-Privacy since they can access people's data
-Algorithmic bias
-Copyright problems
-Data collection issues
-High emphasis on features
Adherence 
-Advocation of what is write
-Evaluate impact of their decisions
-Establishing a code of ethics policy
-Provide resource and education on ethics
-Employing a confidential system
